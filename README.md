# Chronicle

An ambitious Minecraft datapack that reimagines the entire game from the ground up.

> [!CAUTION]
> This datapack is under heavy development. Large and substantial parts of it may frequently change/disappear with zero notice.

### Installation

There are no stable releases yet. This datapack may be manually downloaded by copying the contents of the `datapack` folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This datapack adds a new world type called **Adventure**. To experience everything this datapack has to offer, this world type _must_ be selected in the options menu when starting a new minecraft world.

### Gameplay

Currently this pack only creates a new dimension called Wasteland. True to the name, there isn't much to do there yet, but this section will be regularly updated as new features are added.
